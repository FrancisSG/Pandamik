# Pandamik
The Pandamik web app is an app that will bring a number of services pertaining to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a clear and convenient way, where speed and accessibility is top priority. Users will have access to a map that  can point to the closest testing center, take a relatively simple quiz to determine whether the user should urgently check in with a medical professional or not. The user through the quiz can also get some medical feedback, if they submit a more nuanced form.
